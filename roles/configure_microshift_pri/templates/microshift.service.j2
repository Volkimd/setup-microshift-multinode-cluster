# Control shutdown order by declaring this service to start Before the kubepods.slice
# transient systemd unit; this makes system shutdown delay MicroShift shutdown until
# all the pod containers are down. This is important because some services need access
# to the MicroShift API during shutdown (i.e. releasing leader election locks or cleaning
# up other resources) MicroShift restart or manual stop will not stop the kubepods.slice
